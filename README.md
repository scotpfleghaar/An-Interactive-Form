## An Interactive Form
> JavaScript written by Scot Pfleghaar

### What is this project?
In this project, I created an interactive registration form for "FullStack Conf.".
This project gave me a way to solidify many of the fundamental JavaScript skills and build on them by adding JavaScript best practices.

There are 4 sections on this page: 

* Job Role
* T-Shirt Info
* Register for Activities
* Payment Info

Each section is easy-to-use, interactive and responsive.

Next, form validation was added to ensure the page cannot be submitted unless all required information was used. 

Lastly, I took the concepts I learned in "Refactoring JavaScript - Evan Burchard" which made the code base more readable, increased performance, and more scalable.
